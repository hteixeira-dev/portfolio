                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Henrique Ronchi Teixeira, born on June 20, 2006. I'm a full-stack developer focused on web development technologies. I work with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Python, and have also incorporated tools like React and PostgreSQL into my stack. I prefer well-structured projects, with clean code and solutions that are, above all, functional.</p>

                <p>This website is one of the practical examples of my work. I always aim to build pages that reflect clarity and personality, applying what I’ve learned in a consistent and natural way. I believe the best way to grow is by creating, testing, and refining — and that's how I keep evolving.</p>

                <p>Beyond web development, I’m also interested in other areas of tech such as information security, reverse engineering, and local system automation. These are fields I explore out of curiosity, studying tools, system behavior, and more technical possibilities, always with a hands-on mindset.</p>

                <p>My approach is simple: understand what I’m doing, build with care, and grow with consistency. I strive to keep my projects organized and transparent, respecting both my pace and my process. And this portfolio is a straightforward way to show a bit of all that.</p>
