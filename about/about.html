                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm Henrique Ronchi Teixeira, a full-stack developer from Brazil, with an interest in technologies such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, reverse engineering, and virtual reality.</p>

                <p>I have experience in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, C++, C#, Linux, and basic cybersecurity. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on enhancing my JavaScript skills and working on personal projects.</p>

                <p>This website serves to share a bit of my work and professional growth. I plan to keep it updated and bilingual, in both Portuguese and English, reflecting the evolution of my skills and projects.</p>
